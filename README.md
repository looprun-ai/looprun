# looprun

**A governance layer for LLM agents, on top of the framework you already use.**

Your agent framework is the car — the engine that runs the *think → call tool → reply* loop.
looprun adds everything that makes it safe to hand the keys to an agent:

- **The map** — an `AgentSpec`: which tools, in what order, under which state conditions, with what persona and behavior.
- **The safety kit** — typed **deterministic guards** (seatbelt, airbag, speed limiter): every rule is a
  machine-checked `check()` paired with the LLM-facing `prose()` rendered into the prompt. Guards read
  tool args, world state and the agent's own verified actions — **never the user's text**, so a clever
  prompt can't steer them.
- **The GPS with course-correction** — when the reply violates its checks, a bounded no-tools *redrive*
  corrects it; when correction fails, a **deterministic honest-abstain closure** (a pure function of what
  verifiably happened) goes out instead of a fabrication.
- **The map generator** — the [`agentspec` skill](skills/agentspec/SKILL.md) interviews you (one
  question), then generates the specs, the theme, the tool world **and the eval set that certifies them**.

The governed agent is still a **genuine Mastra `Agent`** — it registers in your Mastra instance and shows
up in Mastra Studio with the guards enforcing live.

```ts
import { LoopRunAgent } from 'looprun/mastra'
import { bookkeepingSpec } from './src/agents/accounting/ac-books-spec.js'

export const booksAgent = new LoopRunAgent({
  spec: bookkeepingSpec,        // generated — carries its guards, persona and domain theme
  world,                        // your tool world (or pass native/MCP `tools` + a `stateView`)
  model: 'openai/gpt-5.5',      // any Mastra router string or AI-SDK model — trivial swap
})

const res = await booksAgent.generate('Close the Q2 books')
res.text          // the governed reply
res.looprun       // what the safety kit did: vetoes, redrives, violations, observed calls
```

Local models are first-class — three run tiers of one validated model (plus a small-RAM fallback)
run on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) with measured flags, including lossless
multi-token-prediction speculative decoding (~1.4× decode, byte-identical output at temp 0):

```ts
import { localModel } from 'looprun/models'

model: await localModel('ram24')       // DEFAULT — 24 GB machines, 11.8 GB, 88.9% certified eval, ~56 tok/s
model: await localModel('ram16')       // 16 GB machines — 13.4–13.5 GB RSS measured, ~44 tok/s
model: await localModel('ram32')       // 32 GB machines, quality-max — 17.2 GB, ~58 tok/s
model: await localModel('ram8')        // 8 GB machines — 4.62 GB RSS measured, ~43 tok/s (4B)
// tier names re-keyed to RAM class 2026-07-15 (old micro/minimal/normal/pro still accepted)
```

Requirements: a `llama-server` build **≥ b9780**
([releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases) — older builds cannot load the
qwen3.5/3.6 family), found via `$LLAMA_BIN` → `~/llamacpp-b9780/bin/llama-server` → `PATH`.
Model weights download **consent-first** — never automatically on an agent's first turn:

```bash
npx looprun models pull qwen3.5-4b      # explicit download (or: npx looprun init, interactive)
npx looprun models status               # binary / model file / server health
```

## Install

```bash
npm i looprun @mastra/core ai zod        # the library
npx skills add looprun-ai/looprun --skill agentspec # the generator skill (any skills-compatible coding agent)
npm i -D @looprun-ai/eval                   # the eval harness (certification)
npx looprun init                         # environment check + optional local-model download
```

## The workflow

1. **Generate** — invoke the `agentspec` skill with one sentence (“*assistant for a small accounting
   firm*”). It decomposes the tool surface into ≤15-tool agents, drafts each `AgentSpec` + the domain
   theme, and generates an eval set — every artifact validated by adversarial debate
   ([BARRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25203)-style), never by self-review.
2. **Measure** — `npx looprun-eval run` executes the eval set against the real loop
   (invariant gate: deterministic auto-fails), then the LLM judge grades the rubric.
   Fix, re-screen, iterate (≤3 rounds).
3. **Certify** — `npx looprun-eval certify` (N=3) at the ≥90% bar → `CERT.md`. Your agents ship with a
   birth certificate, not vibes.
4. **Run** — register the `LoopRunAgent`s in your Mastra instance; `mastra dev` opens Studio with the
   guards live.
